Introduction
Given an array, count pairs in the array such that one element of the pair divides the other.
Examples: 
 

Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output : 2
The two pairs are (1, 2) and (1, 3)

Given two arrays: arr1[0..m-1] and arr2[0..n-1]. Find whether arr2[] is a subset of arr1[] or not. Both the arrays are not in sorted order. It may be assumed that elements in both arrays are distinct.

Examples: 

Input: arr1[] = {11, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7}, arr2[] = {11, 3, 7, 1} 
Output: arr2[] is a subset of arr1[]
